About me
======

With a Ph.D. from the European University Institute in Florence, I’m currently a research fellow at the University of Bologna. My interests in economics are broad and varied: I’ve explored industrial organization, focusing on both theoretical and empirical aspects, with a particular emphasis on digital platforms. My work also extends to the economics of migration, culture through media, and political science, especially concerning the European Parliament. 
Recently, I've been honing my focus on industrial organization, deepening my expertise in this area.

Beyond academia, I’m passionate about the NBA and have been persistently working (though not yet successfully) on developing prediction models for games.
