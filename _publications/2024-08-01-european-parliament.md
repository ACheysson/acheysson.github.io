excerpt: 'This study explores whether pro-/anti-European integration stances have become the dominant dimension of voting in the European Parliament, surpassing the traditional left-right axis. Analyzing over 41 million roll-call votes from 1979-2022, the authors find that the pro-/anti-European axis became prominent during the eurozone crisis. Contrary to the belief that this shift was temporary and limited to specific policy areas, the study reveals that the European dimension has grown across all policy areas. This suggests a secular change in the EP, where pro-/anti-European positions now consistently drive voting behavior, independent of the legislative agenda.'

Abstract
=========

We investigate whether pro-/anti-European integration stances have become the most relevant dimension of voting in the European Parliament (EP), superseding the traditional left-right axis. Using a new database with more than 41 million observations on roll-call votes cast in the EP during 1979-2022, we show that the pro-/anti-European axis became the main dimension of voting during the eurozone crisis. We challenge the view that this was the result of a temporary change in the legislative agenda dictated by the crisis and affecting only a few policy areas. We find that the European dimension grew across all policy areas, suggesting that the EP has undergone a secular change in which pro-/anti-European stances have become the main dimension of voting regardless of any agenda changes.
