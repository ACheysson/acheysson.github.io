In this class, I taught python from scratch to master's students. I covered set-up, base python use, base econometrics, webscraping, text analysis, GIS data and bits of machine learning.

Class 1
===========

Class 1 was about the very basics of Python. Including installing anaconda to manage packages and spyder as the main IDE for the class. The class itself uses jupyter notebook with Rise
to be read and presented as a slideshow.

Use the pdf slides to install python, then read the notebook for the first bits of programming.
